# mkdir
mkdir can be used to create folders in the current directory, like this:

```
mkdir kitten_photos
```
mkdir can also do these things:

- It can also make parent directories with the '-p' option: 'mkdir -p important_documents/tax_info'
- Finally it can display a message for each directory made with the '-v' option: 'mkdir -v love_notes'
